                <li>Spread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each ciabatta roll. Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each roll; top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms, red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and spread evenly atop the meats. Finish by topping with provolone cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.</li>
                <li>Cook sandwiches on preheated panini press until there are dark brown grill marks on the bread, the cheese is melted, and the center is warm, about 5 minutes.</li>
